## Installation

* Setup Jekyll following GitHub instructions: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/
  * To install Jekyll on Windows (7) follow these instructions: http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/
  * At the time of writing this I used following install packages: `rubyinstaller-2.2.3-x64.exe` and `DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2-20130224-1432-sfx.exe`.
* Remember to update Jekyll occasionally by running `bundle update`.
